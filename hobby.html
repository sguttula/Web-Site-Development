				  Basketball originated in Springfield, Massachusetts by a Canadian physical education teacher named Dr. James Naismith.
			<br />Baskteball was originally played by a soccer ball, which then later changed to be played by an official basketball in the late 1950's.
			<br />Basketball is also played in professional leagues nationally and internationally by both males and females between the ages of 18-40.
			<br />The most famous league nation wide and also internationally is the National Basketball Association (NBA) which has many great athletes.
			<br />These are many great players that have changed the game of basketball and have inspired me to practice my work ethic and become
			<br />a great player like them as well.

		<p> Basketball is a great sport! </p>
