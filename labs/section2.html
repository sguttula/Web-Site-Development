				William Shakespeare (/ˈʃeɪkspɪər/;[1] 26 April 1564 (baptised) – 23 April 1616)[nb 1] was an English poet,
				playwright, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent
				dramatist.[2] He is often called England's national poet, and the "Bard of Avon".[3][nb 2] His extant works,
				including collaborations, consist of approximately 38 plays,[nb 3] 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems,
				and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living 
				language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.[4]
				Shakespeare was born and brought up in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18,
				he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith.
				Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and
				part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men.
				He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613, at age 49, where he died three years later. 
				Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive, which has stimulated considerable speculation
				about such matters as his physical appearance, sexuality, and religious beliefs, and whether the 
				works attributed to him were written by others.[5]
				Shakespeare produced most of his known work between 1589 and 1613.[6][nb 4] His early plays were
				primarily comedies and histories, and these are regarded as some of the best work ever produced in
				these genres. He then wrote mainly tragedies until about 1608, including Hamlet, Othello, King Lear,
				and Macbeth, considered some of the finest works in the English language.[2] In his last phase, he
				wrote tragicomedies, also known as romances, and collaborated with other playwrights.
				Many of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime. 
				In 1623, however, John Heminges and Henry Condell, two friends and fellow actors of Shakespeare,
				published a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of his
				dramatic works that included all but two of the plays now recognised as Shakespeare's.[7] It was
				prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson, in which Shakespeare is hailed, presciently, as "not of an age,
				but for all time".[7] In the 20th and 21st centuries, his works have been repeatedly adapted and
				rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance. His plays remain highly popular, and
				are constantly studied, performed, and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts 
				throughout the world.
				In 2016, the 400th anniversary of the playwright's death, celebrations will commence in the United
				Kingdom and across the world to honour Shakespeare and his work.[8]
				William Shakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare, an alderman and a successful glover originally 
				from Snitterfield, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent landowning farmer.[9] He was born in 
				Stratford-upon-Avon and baptised there on 26 April 1564. His actual date of birth remains unknown, 
				but is traditionally observed on 23 April, Saint George's Day.[10] This date, which can be traced 
				back to an 18th-century scholar's mistake, has proved appealing to biographers, since Shakespeare
				died 23 April 1616.[11] He was the third child of eight and the eldest surviving son.[12]
				Although no attendance records for the period survive, most biographers agree that Shakespeare was
				probably educated at the King's New School in Stratford,[13] a free school chartered in 1553,[14] 
				about a quarter-mile (400 m) from his home. Grammar schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan
				era, but grammar school curricula were largely similar: the basic Latin text was standardised by royal
				decree,[15] and the school would have provided an intensive education in grammar based upon Latin 
				classical authors.[16]
				Scholars differ on the exact meaning of Greene's words,[32] but most agree that Greene is accusing
				Shakespeare of reaching above his rank in trying to match such university-educated writers as Christopher 
				Marlowe, Thomas Nashe and Greene himself (the so-called "university wits").[33] The italicised phrase
				parodying the line "Oh, tiger's heart wrapped in a woman's hide" from Shakespeare's Henry VI, Part 3,
				along with the pun "Shake-scene", clearly identify Shakespeare as Greene's target. As used here,
				Johannes Factotum ("Jack of all trades") refers to a second-rate tinkerer with the work of others,
				rather than the more common "universal genius".[32][34]
				Greene's attack is the earliest surviving mention of Shakespeare's work in the theatre. Biographers
				suggest that his career may have begun any time from the mid-1580s, to just before Greene's remarks.
				[35] After 1594, Shakespeare's plays were performed only by the Lord Chamberlain's Men, a company 
				owned by a group of players, including Shakespeare, that soon became the leading playing company in
				London.[36] After the death of Queen Elizabeth in 1603, the company was awarded a royal patent by 
				the new King James I, and changed its name to the King's Men.[37]
				In 1599, a partnership of members of the company built their own theatre on the south bank of the
				River Thames, which they named the Globe. In 1608, the partnership also took over the Blackfriars
				indoor theatre. Extant records of Shakespeare's property purchases and investments indicate that
				his association with the company made him a wealthy man,[38] and in 1597 he bought the second-largest
				house in Stratford, New Place, and in 1605, invested in a share of the parish tithes in Stratford.[39]
				This is the entire life about WIlliam Shakespere with full details. Have fun!
