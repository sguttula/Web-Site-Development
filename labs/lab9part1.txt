1. 	The stylesheet link using the external stylesheet is <a href="../style/style.css"></a>

2. 	The color of the paragraphs will be #0000FF because an html document first renders in-line css,
	then internal css, and then external css. It's all in order so that's why.


3.	The title element goes inside the head element because it defines the title in the browser
	toolbar and displays a title for the page in search-engine results. You can not have more than
	one title element and if you omit the title element the document will not render in html.	

4.	It is more organized and you can link as many other html documents to the external stylesheets.

5. 	It's where the information gets sent to.

6.	No script works as it defines an alternative information for users with disabled scripts or
	that their browser does not support it.
