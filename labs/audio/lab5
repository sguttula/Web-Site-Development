			Chino Hills High School, abbreviated CHHS, is located in Chino Hills, California and is one of the four regular high schools in the Chino Valley Unified School District. The school was established in 2001.
			CHHS is a comprehensive school serving a very economically and socially diverse student body from three cities in the Chino Valley. The school has shifted its focus toward smaller learning communities, as its size continues to grow.

			The student population is fairly diverse demographically, and very diverse socioeconomically. Students come from some of the most wealthy and most disadvantaged areas in San Bernardino County. The demographic breakdown is as follows: 5% African American, 20% Asian, 35% Hispanic/Latino, and 40% Caucasian. In recent years, the population of Asian American students has risen drastically. Approximately 15% receive reduced lunch, and more than 30 languages are spoken by CHHS students.
