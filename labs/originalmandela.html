						  Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, who was born on 18 July 1918 and died in 2013 on the day of December
						<br />5th was a South African anti-apartheid revolt, philant, and politition, who served as President
						<br />of South Africa from 1994 to 1999 and was the country's first black chief executive. On December 5, 1956, Mandela and 155 other activists were arrested and went on trial for treason. All of the defendants were acquitted in 1961, but in the meantime tensions within the ANC escalated, with a militant faction splitting off in 1959 to form the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC).
						In 1944, Mandela joined the African National Congress (ANC) and worked with fellow party members, including Oliver Tambo, to establish its youth league, the ANCYL. That same year, he met and married his first wife, Evelyn Ntoko Mase (1922-2004), with whom he had four
						<br />children before their divorce in 1957.

		<h2> Life </h2>		
				<p>
						Mandela 
						<br />first elected in a fully representative
						democratic election. His government focused on 
						dismantling the legacy of apartheid through 
						tackling institutionalised racism and fostering 
						racial reconciliation. Politically an African nationalist and democratic socialist, he
						served as President of the African National Congress
						party from 1991 to 1997. Internationally, Mandela was  
						Secretary General of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1998 to 1999. 
						Mandela was a controversial figure for much of his life. 
				</p>
		<h2> Education </h2>		
				<p>
						Denounced as a communist terrorist by critics, he nevertheless gained
						international acclaim for his activism, having received more than 250 honours, 
						including the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize, the US Presidential Medal of Freedom, 
						and the Soviet Lenin Peace Prize. He is held in deep respect within South Africa,
						where he is often referred to by his Xhosa clan name, Madiba, or as Tata, he is 
						often described as the "Father of the Nation".

		<h2> Personal Life </h2>	
			<p>
					The first in his family to receive a formal education, Mandela completed his primary studies at a local missionary school. There, a teacher dubbed him Nelson as part of a common practice of giving African students English names. He went on to attend the Clarkebury Boarding Institute and Healdtown, a Methodist secondary school, where he excelled in boxing and track as well as academics. In 1939 Mandela entered the elite University of Fort Hare, the only Western-style higher learning institute for South African blacks at the time. The following year, he and several other students, including his friend and future business partner Oliver Tambo (1917-1993), were sent home for participating in a boycott against university policies.

					After learning that his guardian had arranged a marriage for him, Mandela fled to Johannesburg and worked first as a night watchman and then as a law clerk while completing his bachelor’s degree by correspondence. He studied law at the University of Witwatersrand, where he became involved in the movement against racial discrimination and forged key relationships with black and white activists.
					
					Nelson Mandela’s commitment to politics and the ANC grew stronger after the 1948 election victory of the Afrikaner-dominated National Party, which introduced a formal system of racial classification and segregation—apartheid—that restricted nonwhites’ basic rights and barred them from government while maintaining white minority rule. The following year, the ANC adopted the ANCYL’s plan to achieve full citizenship for all South Africans through boycotts, strikes, civil disobedience and other nonviolent methods. Mandela helped lead the ANC’s 1952 Campaign for the Defiance of Unjust Laws, traveling across the country to organize protests against discriminatory policies, and promoted the manifesto known as the Freedom Charter, ratified by the Congress of the People in 1955. Also in 1952, Mandela and Tambo opened South Africa’s first black law firm, which offered free or low-cost legal counsel to those affected by apartheid legislation.

					The next year, police opened fire on peaceful black protesters in the township of Sharpeville, killing 69 people; as panic, anger and riots swept the country in the massacre’s aftermath, the apartheid government banned both the ANC and the PAC. Forced to go underground and wear disguises to evade detection, Mandela decided that the time had come for a more radical approach than passive resistance.
