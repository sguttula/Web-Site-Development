						An apple pie is a fruit pie in which the principal filling ingredient is apple. It is, on occasion,
					<br />served with whipped cream or ice cream on top, or alongside cheddar cheese. The pastry is generally used top-and-bottom,
					<br />making it a double-crust pie, the upper crust of which may be a circular shaped crust or a pastry lattice woven of strips;
					<br />exceptions are deep-dish apple pie with a top crust only. These are the general forms of making an apple pie,
					<br />but follow this recipe and you will love the taste!

									8 Granny Smith apples can get a little sweet,
							<br /> your wish to reduce to 6, but nothing less than 5.
							<br /> Sugar is mandatory, even though you're watching it melt,
							<br /> it really smells nice and also great flavor.
							<br /> Butter should be left in the fridge, but if left outside,
							<br /> is only good for 1 to 2 days.
							<br /> Wait for 5 to 10 min. because the pie will be very hot.
