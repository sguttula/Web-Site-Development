				Plato
				was a greek philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the
				Western world. He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition.
				Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato's entire œuvre is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years.

				Along with his teacher, Socrates, and his most famous student, Aristotle, Plato laid the very foundations of Western philosophy and science.
				Alfred North Whitehead once noted: "the safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of
				a series of footnotes to Plato." In addition to being a foundational figure for Western science, philosophy, and mathematics, Plato has
				also often been cited as one of the founders of Western religion and spirituality, particularly Christianity, which Friedrich Nietzsche,
				amongst other scholars, called "Platonism for the people." Plato's influence on Christian thought is often thought to be mediated by his
				major influence on Saint Augustine of Hippo, one of the most important philosophers and theologians in the history of Christianity.
				
				Plato was the innovator of the dialogue and dialectic forms in philosophy, which originate with him. Plato appears to have been the founder
				of Western political philosophy, with his Republic, and Laws among other dialogues, providing some of the earliest extant treatments of political
				questions from a philosophical perspective. Plato's own most decisive philosophical influences are usually thought to have been Socrates,
				Parmenides, Heraclitus and Pythagoras, although few of his predecessors' works remain extant and much of what we know about these figures
				today derives from Plato himself.

				The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy describes Plato as "...one of the most dazzling writers in the Western literary tradition and one of the most
				penetrating, wide-ranging, and influential authors in the history of philosophy...He was not the first thinker or writer to whom the word “philosopher”
				should be applied. But he was so self-conscious about how philosophy should be conceived, and he so transformed
				the intellectual currents with which he grappled, that the subject of philosophy, as it is often conceived—a rigorous and systematic examination of ethical,
				political, metaphysical, and epistemological issues, armed with a distinctive method—can be called his invention. Few other authors in the history of Western
				philosophy approximate him in depth and range: perhaps only Aristotle, Aquinas and Kant would be generally agreed to be of the same rank."
			
				Due to a lack of surviving accounts, little is known about Plato's early life and education. The philosopher came from one of the wealthiest
				and most politically active families in Athens. Ancient sources describe him as a bright though modest boy who excelled in his studies. His
				father contributed all which was necessary to give to his son a good education, and, therefore, Plato must have been instructed in grammar,
				music, gymnastics and philosophy by some of the most distinguished teachers of his era
				
				The traditional date of Plato's birth is based on a dubious interpretation of Diogenes Laertius, "When Socrates was gone,
				joined Cratylus the Heracleitean and Hermogenes, who philosophized in the manner of Parmenides. Then, at twenty-eight, Hermodorus says,
				went to Euclides in Megara." As Debra Nails argues, "The text itself gives no reason to infer that Plato left immediately for Megara and
				implies the very opposite." In his Seventh Letter, Plato notes that his coming of age coincided with the taking of power by the Thirty,
				remarking, "But a youth under the age of twenty made himself a laughingstock if he attempted to enter the political arena." Thus, Nails dates 
				Plato's birth to 424/423.
				
				The exact time and place of Plato's birth are unknown, but it is certain that he belonged to an aristocratic and influential family. Based
				on ancient sources, most modern scholars believe that he was born in Athens or Aegina[c] between 429 and 423 BCE. His father was Ariston.
				According to a disputed tradition, reported by Diogenes Laertius, Ariston traced his descent from the king of Athens, Codrus, and the king
				of Messenia, Melanthus. Plato's mother was Perictione, whose family boasted of a relationship with the famous Athenian lawmaker and
				lyric poet Solon. Perictione was sister of Charmides and niece of Critias, both prominent figures of the Thirty Tyrants, the brief
				oligarchic regime, which followed on the collapse of Athens at the end of the Peloponnesian War. Besides Plato himself,
				Ariston and Perictione had three other children; these were two sons, Adeimantus and Glaucon, and a daughter Potone, the mother of Speusippus
				(the nephew and successor of Plato as head of his philosophical Academy). The brothers Adeimantus and Glaucon are mentioned in the Republic
				as sons of Ariston, and presumably brothers of Plato, but some have argued they were uncles. But in a scenario in the Memorabilia,
				Xenophon confused the issue by presenting a Glaucon much younger than Plato. Plato was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world.
				We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light. Arisotle and Plato are very similar.
